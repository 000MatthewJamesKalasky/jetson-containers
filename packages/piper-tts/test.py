TEXT_EN="""A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection, refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky.
It takes the form of a multi-colored circular arc.
Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the Sun.
With tenure, Suzieâ€™d have all the more leisure for yachting, but her publications are no good.
